# Gadget2_polysink

## Modified Version of Cosmological simulation code Gadget2 with polytropic EOS, sink particles and external pressure boundaries. Suited for simulating star formation from collapsing gas clouds using smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH). 

The code can be used for simulating gravothermal collapse, fragmentation and consequent star formation in primordial gas clouds with polytropic equation of state.
